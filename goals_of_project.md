# Goals of Project

Make a neural network that can make music

## What has already been done

Generating pokemon-music article with RNNs and

## What we could do

Use different music

Expand instruments output

Teach it pauses

Different data processing

Encoder-Decoder model to allow different instruments

Get chords to work

Using a CNN model

Investigate how other successful models work

## What we end up doing

Use different music

Expand instruments output

Get chords to work
