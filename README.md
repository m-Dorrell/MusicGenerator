Generates music using neural networks and learns from retro game soundtracks as MIDI files

## Description

As part of the University of Western Australia's software engineering unit CITS4404 - Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive Systems, we are required to produce a piece of software that uses machine learning for an *interesting task*.
The goal of this project is to use neural networks to develop a generative model to compose music after being trained on music of a certain type.

## How to Run

Open the respective jupyter notebook files and run though
